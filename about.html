The Rock Creations by God2 was created solely by taking a rock and painting colorful designs on it. Then inscribing inspirational scriptures to them. The business was then expanded to include acrylic art canvases and various wooden and metal items. Also, we have products that were designed with the paint left over from art called paint skins.

The vision of this Ministry is to raise awareness of the Lord God and show that He is the Rock of all.

The word of God says in <span class="highlight-Psalm">Psalm 62:1, “You can always turn to God who is the Rock”.</span>

In my dream...a teacher told me to write the name Daniel down.

You see Daniel was humble, obedient, and honored by God, enough to be raised to positions of leadership, given long life, entrusting visions and dreams.

My desire is to write good sound books that show people the way to eternal life.

To paint rocks that honor and show others the way to God. To use my artistic skills to bring glory to Him.

 <span class="highlight-Daniel">That is my response to My Daniel Dream.</span>
